# CheckMate 1
This is where I store thing that My first game project, 'CheckMate'.  
The project was built from July 31, 2018 to August 3, 2018.  
This code has some problem.
If I have a chance, I would like to re-create it with C++.

Problem
1. I didn't know the game loop, so I used multi-thread instead of it. (One dynamic object is one thread.)
2. So there are many bugs.
