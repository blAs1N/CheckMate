# CheckMate

This is where I store thing that My first game project, 'CheckMate'.  
The project was built from July 31, 2018 to August 3, 2018.  
This code has some problem.
If I have a chance, I would like to re-create it with C++.

## Problem

At that time I didn't know how to implement virtual functions in C. So I used multi-thread instead of it. (One dynamic object is one thread.) So there have many bugs.
